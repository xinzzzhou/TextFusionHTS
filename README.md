## Datasets
Please access the well pre-processed Wiki-People and News datasets from [[Google Drive]](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GgaMDso5rEJu0Rc9XkNE9wXBqa4hm1yJ?usp=drive_link), then place the downloaded contents under the corresponding folders of `/datasets`

## Quick Demo
1. Clone this repository
```
git clone git@github.com:xinzzzhou/TextFusionHTS.git
cd TextFusionHTS
```
2. Config environment
```
conda create --name textfusionhts python=3.8
conda activate textfusionhts
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
pip3 install torch==1.12.1+cu113 torchvision==0.13.1+cu113 torchaudio==0.12.1 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113
```
3. Download datasets and place them under the corresponding folders of `/datasets`
4. Embedding learning, please note: there are required login Hugging Face, please replace the `xxxxxxxxxx` with your own Hugging Face token.
```
python emb_learning.py
```
5. Train and test the model. We provide two main.py files for demonstration purposes under the root folder. 
```
python main_wiki.py
```

## Tips
Drop_last will influence the number of data windows in the end. To achieve a fair comparison, we didn't use drop_last for testing.
